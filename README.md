# hs-java

A fork of [portnov's original project](https://github.com/portnov/hs-java) that uses `ExceptT`-based errors. Updated to
use modern dependencies, so it's compatible with modern projects.

Includes a number of bugfixes, QoL improvements, and new features (notably support for Java 8 `invokedynamic`).
